# LuxeStay Hotel (Prototype)

A clean, responsive hotel website prototype built with HTML, Tailwind CSS (CDN), and vanilla JavaScript.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Home page
- `about.html` — About us
- `rooms.html` — Rooms & Suites
- `amenities.html` — Amenities & Services
- `gallery.html` — Photo gallery with lightbox
- `contact.html` — Contact form + embedded Google Map
- `assets/js` — JavaScript files
- `assets/css/styles.css` — Minor custom styles

## Notes
- Tailwind is loaded via CDN for quick prototyping. For production, consider a build step with a custom Tailwind configuration for performance.
- The contact form is a front-end demo (no backend). Integrate with a server or third-party booking provider for real bookings.
- Replace placeholder images and map location with your hotel assets and coordinates.

## Local testing
1. Open the `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use a live-server extension).
2. For better SEO and performance testing, serve with a static server (e.g., `npx http-server` or VSCode Live Server).
